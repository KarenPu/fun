/**
 * uva 10954 - Add All There are n numbers. We need to get the sum of n numbers with least cost. The cost for each add
 * operation is defined as the sum of the numbers. i.e the cost of 1 + 2 is 3. If you want to add 1, 2 and 3. There are
 * several ways â€“ No.1 1 + 2 = 3, cost = 3 3 + 3 = 6, cost = 6 Total = 9 No.2 1 + 3 = 4, cost = 4 2 + 4 = 6, cost = 6
 * Total = 10 No.3 2 + 3 = 5, cost = 5 1 + 5 = 6, cost = 6 Total = 11 Try to get the least cost for the n numbers.
