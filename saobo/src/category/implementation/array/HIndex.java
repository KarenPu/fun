     *
     * <pre>
     * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to
     * compute the researcher's h-index. According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
     * "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no
     * more than h citations each."
     * For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them
     * had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations
     * each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3. Note: If there are several
     * possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param citations
     * @return
